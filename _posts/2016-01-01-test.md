Because of my recent updates on my desktop, I ended up with a spare ~~shitty~~
Intel Pentium G2130 sitting silently in its box. It doesn't worth that much to
be listed on eBay (actually I did, but no one buys it), so I just leave it there
and forget about it.

Until recently, I decide to use it to build a NAS to keep all of my backups! It
will be a really cool experience since I built my desktop last summer. I haven't
done anything interesting in DIYs for a while.
