Because of my recent updates on my desktop, I ended up with a spare <del>shitty</del>
Intel Pentium G2130 sitting silently in its box. It doesn't worth that much to
be listed on eBay (actually I did, but no one buys it), so I just leave it there
and forget about it.

Until recently, I decide to use it to build a NAS to keep all of my backups! It
will be a really cool experience since I built my desktop last summer. I haven't
done anything interesting in DIYs for a while.

**So let's do it!**

## Preparation

I'm going to use [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/index.html) for my software/operating
system, and I am also looking for other hardwares on eBay. Most likely I will buy
a bunch of used stuffs.

I will need:

- Motherboard
- Power Supply
- RAM
- Hard Drive

## Links

Here are links I found helpful during the whole process.
