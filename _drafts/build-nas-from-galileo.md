It just came to me that building a NAS would be super cool idea. After messing
around online for a little bit, I decided to work on a pilot build with my
Intel Galileo and portable hard disk. If this goes well, and I get more cash
to spend in the future, I would probably build a real beefy NAS later.

**So let's do it!**

## Preparation

I'm going to use [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/index.html) for my software/operating
system, and I am also looking for other hardwares on eBay. Most likely I will buy
a bunch of used stuffs.

I will need:

- Motherboard
- Power Supply
- RAM
- Hard Drive

## Links

Here are some links I found helpful during this build.
