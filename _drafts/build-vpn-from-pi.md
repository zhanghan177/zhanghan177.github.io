I started with the idea of building my own NAS. However, after messing around 
for a while, I realized that I don't have the money for that. :(

However, what I found out is that I **DO** have the cash for a Raspberry Pi and
I can do a lot of fun things with it. I have to admit that I'm still wasting my
money because I already have a Galileo and a BeagleBone Black. Sadly though,
none of them works, or I can't get any of them work for me. My BeagleBone just 
won't connect to my Mac for some reason. Anyway, I made up my mind and decided
to go with the almighty Raspberry Pi.

**So let's do it!**

## Preparation

First thing first. I need to get a Raspberry Pi.

## Links

Here are some links I found helpful during this build.
